This is a 'Mavenised' version of Prefuse, cloned from https://github.com/prefuse/Prefuse with some small tweaks. I've added a multi-resolution image function for my own purposes, which results in different images being shown depending on how many other images are in view.

The rest of this Readme is the original from https://github.com/prefuse/Prefuse.

Prefuse is a set of software tools for creating rich interactive data visualizations in the Java programming language. Prefuse supports a rich set of features for data modeling, visualization, and interaction. It provides optimized data structures for tables, graphs, and trees, a host of layout and visual encoding techniques, and support for animation, dynamic queries, integrated search, and database connectivity.

Prefuse is written in Java, using the Java 2D graphics library, and is easily integrated into Java Swing applications or web applets. Prefuse is licensed under the terms of a BSD license, and can be freely used for both commercial and non-commercial purposes.

Prefuse is a creation of the UC Berkeley Visualization Lab http://vis.berkeley.edu/. For more information see license-prefuse.txt and http://prefuse.org/. 

This repository was initially created from the release available at http://downloads.sourceforge.net/prefuse/prefuse-beta-20071021.zip
